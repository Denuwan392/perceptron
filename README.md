# Perceptron: A Step Towards Intelligent Machines 🤖

Welcome to the **Perceptron** repository! This project is an exploration of one of the simplest and most powerful algorithms in machine learning—the **Perceptron**. It's the building block for neural networks and a great starting point for anyone diving into the world of artificial intelligence.

## 🚀 What is Perceptron?

The Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the way a human brain processes data by making decisions based on weighted inputs, an activation function, and learning from its mistakes through training.

In simpler terms, it's like teaching a machine to recognize patterns through trial and error—much like how we learn to categorize things in life!

## 💡 Key Features

- **Binary Classification**: Classifies data into two categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).
- **Gradient Descent**: Adjusts weights using a simple learning rule for optimal results.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plots and graphs to visualize learning progress.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to expand with more advanced neural network layers.
  
## 🔧 Installation

Clone this repository to get started!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denuwan392/perceptron.git
cd perceptron
```

You’ll need Python 3.7 or higher. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Run the Perceptron training on a dataset:

```bash
python perceptron.py --train data/training_data.csv --epochs 1000
```

Feel free to experiment with different datasets and training configurations!

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes interactive visualizations to help you understand how the Perceptron adjusts its weights over time. These visual tools will provide insights into the learning process, making it easier to see how the algorithm converges to a solution.
